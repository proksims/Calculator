    <H3>C7_SmartCalc_v1.0</H3>
        <br><p>In this project I implement an extended version of the usual calculator.<br> 
            Calculator, which can be found in the standard applications of each operating system in the C programming language using structured programming. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as:<br>
            Addition <br>Subtraction <br>Multiplication <br>Division<br>Power<br>Modulus<br>Unary plus<br>Unary minus<br>Brackets<br><br> 
            I supplement the calculator with the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions:<br>
            cosine<br>sine<br>tangent<br>arc cosine<br>arc sine<br>arc tangent<br>square root<br>natural logarithm<br>common logarithm<br><br> 
            Besides calculating expressions, it also support the use of the x variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.<br>
            As for other improvements i consider a credit calculator.</p>
